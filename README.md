# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Starter code for the project was provided by Lighthouse Labs. I built upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express back-end skills.

The code I wrote for this project is found mainly in the public directory (scripts and styles directories, index.html file).

## Getting Started

Click on the "Write a new tweet" button in the top right corner. A tweet form will slide down.

Input your content and press the tweet button. Tweets will appear in reverse chronological order.

Tweets cannot exceed 140 characters and cannot be empty.

A two column design is set for desktop screens (1024px wide and larger) and a one column design for tablets and phones. Individual tweets have responsive content for devices with screens under 650px wide.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
